# 2AA4_Connect_Four_Final
Final project for SFWR 2AA4 (Intro to Software Design) at McMaster University

This project was made as the final assignment for Dr Wassyng's Software design class.

The project was assigned in three waves. Wave one required the game to be made up to the point of the first move.

Wave two required the game to completely work, as well as allow games to be saved and loaded.

Wave three required a computer opponent to be added.

This project nailed down the idea of modularity and designing for change.
